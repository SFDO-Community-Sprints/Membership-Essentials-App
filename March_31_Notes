# Membership Schema and Benefits

March 31 to April 1 

### Project Team

* Attending: Evan Ponter, Reede Stockton, James Browne, Kai Williams (team lead), Mel Brockley, Collin Zimmerman, Chris Pifer

### Project Details

* NPSP Membership out of the box requires a lot of customization to meet organization’s specific use case.
    * Membership isn’t always a fundraising tool. 
    * Some organizations use membership in a different way: individual and group/organization membership
    * It is not easy to do renewals.
* Example: Hostel International (Evan’s organization)
    * having membership gains you access to benefits/discounts, include in marketing messages, etc. 
    * Physical card, with expiration date. 
    * Using opportunities to represent a membership purchase. OLI/Product2 are used for membership items purchased.
    * Membership record (Custom object), able to associate the membership to the contact or account.
    * Created a membership type to email/online purchase
    * purchase, expires, tracking of physical items
    * Retain membership number (e.g. member 12345)
    * Workflow rule to send an email to the individual based on a field getting modified.
    * Initial purchasing is completed from FormAssembly
    * Renewals
        * Sent through Marketing Cloud
        * Three emails before someone’s membership expires. 
        * Each month has a dedicated SFDC campaign. Adds individuals to a month when they expire. 
        * Uses MAS to populate contacts into the correct month’s campaign. 
        * Currently don’t have auto-renewals
        * Set renewal date to start the day after the end membership
* Example: International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council (Kai’s organization)
    * Has several checkboxes to indicate the type of membership (e.g. auto renewal, include in directory)
    * Delivers physical membership card, created manually
    * Supporting other NGOs to share information/education. Membership benefit is discounted learning.
* Previous discussion is custom object vs opportunity object.

## Evaluate custom object against standard opportunity object

Review V3 of the Membership / Sponsorship Schema with Benefits PDF

* Custom objects
    * Pros
        * Allows for quick free memberships. 
        * Allows for opportunity to exist only for transaction (exchange of money).
        * Allow for easy record type separation of memberships
        * Allows for a single purchase to include multiple memberships (e.g. corporation purchases a membership for 5 employees)
    * Cons
        * Another object/record
        * Requires custom architecture for multiple individuals to a membership.
* Standard/Opportunity objects
    * Pros
        * One less object to maintain (FSL, storage, etc.)
        * NPSP solutions already exists (e.g.rollups, levels, etc.)
    * Cons
        * Confusion membership with donations, purchases, etc. Other transactions
        * OCRs can’t have external IDs
        * Creates an empty $0 opportunity for free memberships
        * How are memberships bundled 
* Orders standard object
    * Pros
        * Functions like opportunity but is its own object.
        * Has native “bill to contact” and “Ship to Contact”
    * Cons
        * Might confuse “Orders” and require renaming to “membership”
        * Doesn’t support multiple payments against a membership.
        * Creates the same frustration as with Opportunities (an org could use orders natively) 

Team chooses, custom object.

### Use cases trying to solve

*  basic
* middle architecture
* open architecture for an ISV

### Steps for tomorrow

* Recreate the ERD
* Add a Git project for building 
* Have clear documentation for path to choose. 

## Outstanding questions

* What about upgrades (e.g. you purchase a ticket and decide to upgrade to a membership)
    * we need the ability to discount
    * we need a way to show both purchases (ticket and later upgrade)
* How do you renew
* What happens if someone’s membership is purchased early
* What about gift memberships

## Random thoughts

* The ability to specify members automatically
