# Membership Schema And Benefits
For accomplishments by sprint, please refer to the Wiki.

### Project Vision 
A schema for memberships, sponsorship, renewals, payments, multiple members, families, benefits, etc, that actually works. Eventually automation etc.

* **What is the big problem that your project is trying to solve?**
    The existing NPSP membership data model is very lightweight and doesn't meet many orgs' needs. We seek to design a data model that is flexible and extensible for a wide range of membership and entitlement models including memberships and sponsonships. 

* **Who will be using your project?**
    Organizations that have any form of membership or sponsorship, paid or unpaid. 

* **A year from now, how do you see people describing your project?**
    A foundational data structure that can be extended and modified

* **Use these questions to form a clear vision statement of 3-5 sentences (rough guideline).** 
Focusing on membership, whioch will be in a separate non-NPSP package (to avoid dependencies); this includes a primary Membership object to list current membership and Membership Contact Roles to list the various connections as there may be more than one member; financial aspects will included later builds but are not part of the MVP.

## Next Steps
These are listed on the home page of the [Wiki](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/MembershipSchemaAndBenefits/wiki)

### Code
Using a combination of Cumulus & Metecho has contributed to open Tasks & unmerged branches; we try to wrap everything up at the end of each sprint so the next Sprint doesn't have to start by figuring out what still needs to be merged.
