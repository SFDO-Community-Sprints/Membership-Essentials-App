# Membership Schema And Benefits
For accomplishments by sprint, please refer to the Wiki.

### Project Vision 
Membership can mean something different for each organizations, but managing memberships has never been straightforward in Salesforce. 

The goal of the membership management project is to build a common data model and supporting automations for managing memberships in Salesforce. The goal is for the model to support everything from museums and alumni associations to  sustaining donor programs and community gardens.

* **What is the big problem that your project is trying to solve?**
    The existing NPSP membership data model is very lightweight and doesn't meet many orgs' needs. We seek to design a data model that is flexible and extensible for a wide range of membership and entitlement models including memberships and sponsonships. 

* **Who will be using your project?**
    Organizations that have any form of membership or sponsorship, paid or unpaid. 

* **A year from now, how do you see people describing your project?**
    A foundational data structure that can be extended and modified

* **Use these questions to form a clear vision statement of 3-5 sentences (rough guideline).** 
Focusing on membership, whioch will be in a separate non-NPSP package (to avoid dependencies); this includes a primary Membership object to list current membership and Membership Contact Roles to list the various connections as there may be more than one member; financial aspects will included later builds but are not part of the MVP.

## Next Steps
These are listed on the home page of the [Wiki](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/MembershipSchemaAndBenefits/wiki)

### Code
Using a combination of Cumulus & Metecho has contributed to open Tasks & unmerged branches; we try to wrap everything up at the end of each sprint so the next Sprint doesn't have to start by figuring out what still needs to be merged.
