CHALLENGES

Membership (subscriptions) models
Time period: i.e. daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, or Biannual Yearly Renewals; joining for 3 months, then merge on to the annual cycle
Product: level (e.g. gold, silver, bronze) -> sometimes tiered to benefits (magazine, discounts, event attendance, priority access to information/newsletters/helplines) 
Some products may give one-off benefit (teddy bear)
Members who don’t realise that they members (e.g. people that donate monthly/regularly)
Big givers: ad hoc givers (such as large donations), where they still qualify for benefits; may or may not have expiry periods
Usually there is cost/charge, but sometimes membership is free
Sometimes a one-off first year extra “registration” fee
Some newals are fixed fixed date (e.g. 1st January) and others time-based (yearly), even within the same organisation; particularly if there are two different products (e.g. friendship scheme, with a season’s theatre discount package on top)


Renewals
Temporarily suspend membership (sometimes have to pay the catchup fees; sometimes waived)
Discretionary hardship waiving of fees for limited periods of time that need to be monitored (then alerted on!)
Upgrades and downgrades (is this effective immediately, or only at time of next renewal); see Payments!
Renewals can be discounted for a specified period of time (e.g. first 3 months free, or a discount on the 2nd year)
Changing membership during the year and want it to be upgraded for the whole year
Combining different discounts (based on age, qualifications, other features)


Payments
Direct Debits are sent to bank in advance, so if people have already paid for a service and this is changed, how is this handled - waived or catchup payment at next time
In the Netherlands there is a law where people can reclaim any payment for up to 7 years; this needs to be handled.
Gift Aid! So in the UK, the charity can reclaim 25%. This needs to be documented in the system.
Credit cards, which payment is listed on the system and then arrives later. Some charities regard the membership live as soon as the payment is registered, some only the payment arrives! Some backdate it to the 1st of the month regardless of payment date.


Reporting
Membership periods - how long have people been members, and how long have they been members with a particular level; this needs to be exposed on contact via Roll Up/DLRS)


Reasons why a charity wants memberships:
Engagement 
Forecasting
Up-selling! (upgrading memberships) / incentives



USE CASE

Buy a membership / subscriptiona
Memberships offered at various levels with 
different prices & benefits attached
Sign up online or email org to express interest / get related information.  
Decide on level right for person - 
that maybe based on individual preference or 
based on meeting criteria outlined by organisation (eg National Trust - based on HH numbers, kids ages etc)
Sign up
Payment - instant payment by card payments OR DD payments periodically
Renewal periodically - most common is automatic monthly or annual (rolling contract) BUT needs to have an end date (when an auto renewal is not relevant)

2. Upgrade / downgrade - a mid term upgrade or downgrade (sometimes due to hardship) of membership.  The calculation of their due amount changes if they are paying monthly/qrterly - need this re-calculation to be done on the back end (this costs money because of the manual lift to do calculations). Should obviously be able to upgrade/downgrade at renewal date.

3. Discount - first 3 months at ½ price / month 1 free etc.  Need to be able to calculate the short term cost and then revert to full cost at the right time.  

4. Hierarchical memberships - Corporate, Household, Individual & associated discounts



CUSTOMISATIONS NEEDED
Length of current membership, length of total membership
Payments: pay last 3 months in one go.


1.	Sign up
